S3 Select: 只是S3一个功能,干嘛的呢，本来要get完整的Object,现在可以只选取部分，多好
Athena: 一个query service, 用来查询S3里面的信息的，使用standard SQL 语法
Redshift Spectrum:是redshift的一个功能，enables you to run queries against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3 with no loading or ETL required. 就是直接查询大量的数据，不需要load
kinesis firehore 可以发送到 -> S3, Elastic search, Redshift, Splunk都可以！
数据转移话费：
EC2 -> RDS, Redshift, DynamoDB Accelerator and ElasticCache 如果在同一个AZ,不收费，不是，则收费
EC2 -> S3,DynamoDB, SQS, kinesis, SES, ECR, SNS, SimpleDB 通过一个region之间数据transfer 不收费

Amazon EMR: 你可以manage Hadoop framework,这些server都放在EC2上面的，所以你可以玩


CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies provide the same basic functionality: they allow you to control who can access your content. If you want to serve private content through CloudFront and you're trying to decide whether to use signed URLs or signed cookies, consider the following:

Use signed URLs for the following cases:

-You want to use an RTMP distribution. Signed cookies aren't supported for RTMP distributions.
-You want to restrict access to individual files, for example, an installation download for your application.
-Your users are using a client (for example, a custom HTTP client) that doesn't support cookies.
Use signed cookies for the following cases:

-You want to provide access to multiple restricted files, for example, all of the files for a video in HLS format or all of the files in the subscribers' area of a website.
-You don't want to change your current URLs.
